# What It This?
  **The template ASP.NET 8 Core API microservice which is built by Onion Architecture.**
  >*In this solution, dependencies between libraries are immediately set in accordance with Onion Architecture. This template makes it easy to deploy a microservice project with the name you choose. All you need to do is download the project and execute Initializer.exe - Python script to replace the rods in your name.*

# How do I deploy the template?
- Upload a project from GitHub (*git clone https://github.com/qpashkaaa/NET8-Onion-Architecture-Microservice-Template.git*).
- Go to the root of the uploaded project.
- Run the file ***Initializer.exe*** - a console application written in Python that allows you to replace the tag in the project name with your own name (the Python script code itself is presented below).
- Follow the instructions provided in the application.
- After a successful replacement, check the file names in the solution explorer.
- If everything went well, you can delete the file Initializer.exe, or leave it in case you need to change the name of the solution and related projects.
